      "question": "When is my payment due date?",
      "answer": "Your payment due date is typically 20-25 days after your statement date.

      "question": "How can I set up auto-debit for my credit card?",
      "answer": "You can set up auto-debit by: 1) Logging into our app and going to 'Auto-debit' settings, 2) Visiting our website and accessing payment settings, 3) Filling the auto-debit form and submitting it, or 4) Calling customer service. You'll need to provide your bank account details and choose to pay minimum due or full amount."

    {
      "question": "What is the minimum due amount?",
      "answer": "The minimum due amount is typically 5% of your total outstanding balance (subject to a minimum of ₹100-₹500 depending on your card). Paying only the minimum due keeps your account active but interest is charged on the remaining balance. It's recommended to pay the full amount to avoid interest."
