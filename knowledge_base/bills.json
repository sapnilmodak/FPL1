      "question": "What is my billing cycle?",
      "answer": "Your billing cycle is typically 30 days, starting from the date your card was activated. Your statement is generated on the same date each month (statement date), and the payment is due 20-25 days after the statement date (due date). You can check your exact billing cycle in the app or on your statement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a late fee?",
